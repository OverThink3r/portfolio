        I am currently 23 years old, I like to read about personal development, psychology and stoicism.
        I enjoy playing video games, sports and I live in the beautiful city of Morelia in Michoacán de Ocampo, México.
        I like to work on complex and exciting projects that test my skills to improve and provide a valuable product,
        as well as being in contact with a team with which we can work side by side.
