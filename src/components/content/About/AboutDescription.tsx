        I have had the opportunity to work with different programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript and TypeScript. I have used frameworks like Vue JS and React JS as font-end, and technologies like Spring Boot and Node for back-end. I am also familiar with using agile methodologies and frameworks such as SCRUM. In addition to this I know about AWS, services like S3, SES, Cognito, API Gateway, RDS and Lambda. All this carried hand in hand with communication with development teams and dealing directly with customers.
